##Let’s create a sample application about bears. Let’s say there are many bears. There are different types of bears with different weights and danger levels.

##We will also say there are fish. Each fish belongs to a single bear since bears don’t like sharing. This will be our one-to-one relationship. ('Bear to Fish' 1 to 1)

##Bears also love to climb trees. Each bear will have many trees they like to climb. This will be our one-to-many relationship. ('Bear to Trees' 1 to many)

##There will also be picnics. Many bears can go to many picnics since they like to ransack as many delicious picnics as they can. This will be our many-to-many relationship. ('Bear to Picnic' many to many)
